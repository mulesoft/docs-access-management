Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate deployment environments for APIs and applications.  These environments are independent from each other and enable you to test your applications under the same conditions as your production environment.

== Types of Environments

Anypoint Platform supports the following types of environments:

* **Production environment**: Provides a production environment where you can deploy applications and APIs publicly.

* **Sandbox environment**: Provides useful environments for development and testing. By default, Anypoint Platform accounts are created with one sandbox environment with one vCore assigned to it.
+
Sandbox environments enable you to safely test an application without affecting the production environment. For example, you can create a sandbox environment for a QA team where they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment. This helps to secure your production environment and eliminate the risk of a developer accidentally changing an application in production. Once you are sure an application is safe to expose to users, you can easily promote the application from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

* **Design environment**: Enables you to test and run applications at design time. This environment is used by the Design Center application. By default, a new Anypoint Platform account contains one design environment with one vCore assigned to it. Only applications deployed from Design Center can target this environment; you can't deploy an application to a runtime registered in the Design environment using Runtime Manager.

== Adding Users to an Environment

You cannot grant users access to an environment directly. To grant a user access to an environment use role permissions. See xref:roles.adoc#assigning-permissions-to-roles[Assigning Permissions to Roles] for more information.

== To Create a New Environment

To create a new environment or manage an existing environment:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-environments.adoc[]

. Click *Add Environment*.
. Enter a name for the environment.
. Select the environment type.
+
NOTE: You cannot change the environment type after you create your environment.

. Select at least one xref:managing-api-clients.adoc[client provider] for your environment.
. Optionally, if you added more than one client provider, click *Set as default* to designate a default client provider. If you do not select a default client provider, the first client provider that you added is the default.
. Click *Create*.

[NOTE]
* Depending on your CloudHub subscription, you might have restrictions on the number and type of environments you can create.
* If you create a new environment using the name of an existing environment, `-<n>` is appended to the name of the new environment. `<n>` is an incremental number.

== To Modify or Delete an Existing Environment

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-environments.adoc[]

. Click the name of the environment. You can perform one of the following actions:
+
* Modify the environment:
** Enter a new name for the environment.
** Add at least one client provider.
** Designate a default client provider if the environment uses more than one client provider.
+
Click *Update* to save your changes.
* Click *Delete* to delete the environment.

== To View the Client ID and Client Secret for an Environment

Each environment has a client ID and a client secret used for authentication. You must use these values to  configure a customer-hosted Mule Runtime or legacy API Gateway to be able to deploy proxies or APIs to CloudHub.

To view the client ID and secret for your environment:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-environments.adoc[]

. Click the name of the environment whose client ID/secret you want to view.

[NOTE]
--
To change the client ID or client secret of an environment, you must contact your customer support representative.

== Associate a Client Provider with an Existing Environment

If your organization administrator provides multiple xref:managing-api-clients.adoc[client providers] for your organization, you can add them to existing environments. If you did not associate a client provider with the environment when you created it, the default client provider is the Anypoint Platform client provider.

To associate a client provider with an existing environment:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-environments.adoc[]

. Click the name of the environment.
. In the *Client Provider* field, select at least one client provider.
. If you added more than one client provider, click *Set as default* to designate a default client provider.
. Click *Update*.

You can now configure client providers for APIs.

[[remove-an-idp-from-an-environment]]
== Remove a Client Provider from an Environment

You can remove a client provider from an environment at any time. However, prior to removing the default client provider, specify another client provider as default.

When you remove all external client providers from an environment, the built-in Anypoint Platform client provider becomes the default client provider for that environment.

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-environments.adoc[]

. Click the name of the environment.
. If the client provider that you want to remove is the default, click *Set as default* next to the name of a different client provider.
+
. Click the *Remove* button next to the name of the client provider that you want to remove.
. Click *Update*.

The client provider is removed. Any assets or APIs that were associated with the client provider continue to use it until you associate them with a new client provider.
