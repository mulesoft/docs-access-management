[[use_existing_account]]
== Use an Existing Account

You can use an existing account to join an existing organization once you receive an invitation. For example, assume that you are invited to join the *MuleSoft* Organization, and that you have three different Anypoint Platform accounts:

* Member: An account not associated with any organization.
* Admin: An account with the organization administrator role associated to a different organization.
* Owner: An organization owner account for a different organization.

After clicking the link in the invitation, you have one week to choose the account to use to join the organization.

[NOTE]
If the account you want to use is already associated with another root organization, an exclamation mark is displayed next to it. This means that additional steps are needed before migrating the account to a new organization.

[[create_new_account]]
== Create a New Account Within an Existing Organization

You can create a new account within an existing organization only if you receive an email invitation with a link to join the organization. The link expires in one week.

. Click the link in the invitation email.
. Click the *Sign Up* button. +
A sign up window is displayed.
. Enter the following information in the form: +
* Full name - First and last name.
* Email - If your email address is associated with more than one Anypoint Platform account, after clicking the link in the invitation choose one of the following: +

** <<create_new_account,Create a New Account Within an Existing Organization>>
* Phone number - Phone number with area code.
* Username - You can use the same email address for multiple Anypoint Platform accounts, but each account needs a unique username. This enables you to manage all of your Anypoint Platform accounts under a single email address. +
Your username must be at least three characters and contain only the following: +
** Alphanumeric characters
** Dashes
** Underscores
* Password - Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. Your password can contain only the following: +
** Upper and lower case characters
** Numbers
** Non-alphanumeric symbols
. Agree to the terms of service and privacy policy, then click *Accept and create account in <org>*.

[NOTE]
You cannot create a new account within an existing organization without an email invitation.

== Log in to Anypoint Platform

. Navigate to the Anypoint Platform login screen.
. Enter your username and password.
. Click *Sign in*.

[NOTE]
If you try to log in and Anypoint Platform rejects your valid credentials, your organization might use an xref:access-management::external-identity.adoc[external identity provider] to initiate the sign-in process. Either navigate to your external identity provider's interface to sign in, or xref:access-management::managing-your-account.adoc#use-CustomDomainLogin[enter your organization's domain name] before reentering your credentials.

[[use-CustomDomainLogin]]
== Log in to Anypoint Platform Using Single Sign-on

If your organization uses xref:access-management::external-identity.adoc[Single Sign-on], you must provide your organization's domain name as part of the sign-in process.

. Navigate to the Anypoint Platform login screen.
. Click *Use custom domain*.
. Enter your organization's domain name.
+
+ If you do not know your organization's domain name, a member of your organization can provide the organization domain name, which is accessible in their user profile.
. Click *Continue*.
You are redirected to your identity provider.

== Use an Unassociated Account

When an organization administrator deletes an account from the organization, the deleted account is left _unattached_.

You can use an unattached account to join the *MuleSoft* organization with no further configurations needed. +
Select the account, enter its corresponding password, and click *Sign in*.

== Use an Administrator Account

If your account is an organization administrator for a different organization (or business group within that organization), your username is displayed with an exclamation mark next to it. +

You can use this account to join *MuleSoft*, however all existing references from this account to the existing organization are lost. +
After selecting this account and entering the password associated with it, you are asked to confirm your decision. If you proceed:

* If there are other members in the business group you are leaving behind, the organization administrator of the parent organization is automatically assigned as organization administrator for the business group.
* If there are no other members, the business group is deleted.

== Account Associated as an Organization Owner

A common scenario, is to create an account and not associate it with any existing organization. This automatically assigns your account to a _new_ organization and sets your account as an xref:roles.adoc#organization-owner[organization owner]. +

After selecting this account, entering its corresponding password, and clicking the *Sign In* button, if there are no other members in the organization you own:
* You are presented with a warning that all associations to the existing organization will be lost.
* The organization left behind is deleted. +

However, if the organization your account owns has other members, Anypoint Platform won't allow you to migrate to *MuleSoft*.

To _free_ your account from the organization you own, open a support ticket at https://help.mulesoft.com[https://help.mulesoft.com]. Provide the following information:

* The `userId` and `userName` of another user within the organization you own to promote to owner.
* The `Organization Name` and `Organization Id` of said organization. +

After support confirms that the migration is done, you can use your account to join MuleSoft.

[NOTE]
If you have a free trial account and want to migrate your user name to a new organization you need another organization administrator in your current organization to delete your organization owner account from the organization associated with your trial account.

== Known Issue: Account Creation

When you attempt to create an account from an email invitation to join an organization, and you use a username that already exists (even in a different organization), an error appears, erroneously stating your credentials are invalid.
This error occurs when a username already exists, even if it is under a different organization.
If the username already belongs to you, you can move the username from your previous organization to the organization that sent you the email invitation.
