= Configure Client Management with PingFederate
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Anypoint Platform supports only PingFederate versions 6 through 8. For versions 9 or later, you can configure the PingFederate client provider as an OIDC provider by following the instructions in xref:configure-client-management-openid-task.adoc[Configure OpenID Connect Client Management].

When you configure client provider URLs, use the endpoint `/pf-ws/rest/oauth/clients` and not `/as/clients.oauth2`. Do not use PingFederate's dynamic client registration URL for this configuration.

+
. Fill in the following required fields:
+
* OAuth2 Authorization Provider, Authorize URL
+
The authorization endpoint defined by OAuth 2.0 and used to interact directly with resource owners, authenticate owners, and obtain owner authorization. For example:
+
`+https://ec2-55-88-144-83.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9031/as/authorization.oauth2+`
+
* OAuth2 Token Provider, Create URL
+
The endpoint that creates an access token for OAuth authentication. For example:
+
`+https://ec2-55-88-144-83.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9031/as/token.oauth2+`
+
* OAuth2 Token Validation Provider
+
** Validate URL
+
The token endpoint defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification where the client obtains an access token and possibly a refresh token by presenting its authorization grant. For example:
+
`+https://ec2-55-88-144-83.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9031/as/token.oauth2+`
+
** Username Token Mapping
+
