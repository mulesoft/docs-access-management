= Managing Users

As an administrator of your root organization, you can enable, disable, or delete users, assign permissions to users, and edit a user's settings.

On the access management *Users* page, you can:

* Invite users to join your organization.
* Enable and disable users. 
+
When you disable a user, they are no longer able to sign in to your organization.
* Delete users. 
+
When deleting a user from the root organization, all of the user's permissions are removed, and the user becomes unattached. 
* Send a request to a user to reset their password.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that you have:

* The Organization Administrator permission
* The API Version Owner permission if you plan to manage user permissions for your API version

== Invite a User to Anypoint Platform

[NOTE]
--
This feature is not available in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, Government Cloud, or for organizations that use external identity providers for single sign-on (SSO) and have xref:external-identity-index.adoc#account-creation-changes[disabled account creation]. You must manage users, including invitations for new users, through your third-party IdP or LDAP.
--

As an organization administrator of a root organization, you can invite new users and manage existing users for your organization.

To invite new users to your organization:

include::partial$include-nav-users.adoc[]

. Click *Invite user*.
. Enter the email addresses of the users that you want to invite to your organization as a comma-separated list.
. Optionally, select a xref:teams.adoc[team] or xref:roles.adoc[role (deprecated)] to assign permissions to these users.
. Click *Send Invitation*.

The users you specify receive email invitations to join your organization. Invited users must use the link they receive in the invitation to join your organization. When they click the link, they are presented with a sign-up form that already has the *Company* field completed with the name of your organization.

Note that the email link expires in one week.

Invited users have access to the same set of resources as you (although they may have different permissions that restrict what they can view or do).

[[resend-or-cancel-invitation]]
== Resend or Cancel a Sent Invitation

include::partial$include-nav-users.adoc[]

. Click *Pending Invites* to view all invitations that have not yet been accepted. 
. Click the more actions menu (*...*) in the row for the invitation to manage. 
. Select *Re-send Invite* or *Cancel Invite*.

[[access-user-settings]]
== Access the User's Settings Page

The user's *Settings* page is where you can edit the user's first and last name, email address, and exempt them from multi-factor authentication. 

include::partial$include-nav-users.adoc[]

. There are three ways to access the user's *Settings* page:
* Click the user's name in the *Name* column.
* Click the username of the user in the *Username* column.
* Click the more actions menu (*...*) in the user's row, and select *Manage User*. 
. Click the *Settings* tab. 

[[grant-user-permissions]]
== Grant Permissions to Users

Organization administrators manage user access using xref:teams.adoc[teams] or xref:roles.adoc[roles] (deprecated), or by granting permissions to users individually. Teams and roles functionality are mutually exclusive.

In the *Users* page, click a user name to access more information about that user, manage and view permissions, manage and view teams or roles, or reset their password.

By default, in every new organization and business group, you can assign the following:

* Assign API permissions: Select the name of the API you want to give access to, then pick a version and permission.
* Assign Runtime Manager permissions: Select the name of the Runtime Manager environment to give access to, then pick a permission.
* Assign teams: Select the name of the team to give access to.
* Assign roles (deprecated): Select the name of the role to grant. Check the xref:roles.adoc[roles] section for a description of the default roles within an organization and business group.

[NOTE]
--
In the legacy roles user interface, roles and permissions are grouped under organizations (and also, optionally, under business groups). This means that you can only assign roles and permissions that are related to resources that exist in the organization and/or business group that you are selecting. 
--

If necessary, you can also remove user permissions, but note that if those permissions are granted through an assigned team or role, you can remove them only by using the xref:teams.adoc[teams] or xref:roles.adoc[Roles] functionality respectively. You cannot view or remove team-based or role-based permissions in the *Users* page.

Because the Roles feature is deprecated, it is best to xref:teams.adoc#opt-in-to-teams[opt in to the Teams feature by selecting *Try New Features*] to manage permissions in a hierarchy.

You can use the legacy roles interface or the Teams feature to grant permissions to an individual user. 

To grant permissions to an individual user in the legacy roles interface:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-users.adoc[]

. Click the username of the user to which you want to assign permissions.
. In the *Permissions* section, click the product to which you want to assign permissions. 
. In the *Permission(s)* section, in the *Select access* field, select the permissions that you want assign and then click *+*.
. If you selected a product to which you can assign permissions to an environment, in the *Environment* field, select the permissions that you want to assign and then click *+*.
+
The user now has the permissions you selected.

To grant permissions to an individual user with the xref:teams.adoc#opt-in-to-teams[Teams feature] enabled: 

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-users.adoc[]

. Click the name of the user to assign permissions to.
. Click the *Permissions* tab.
. In the *Permissions* section, click *Add permissions*.
+
The *Add Permissions* window appears. 
. In the *Select Permissions* section, select the permissions that you want to add and then click *Next*.
. In the *Select Business Groups* section, select the business groups to which you want to apply the permissions. If you selected a permission that enables you to select environments, you can select which environments to apply to the permission. Click *Next*. 
+
In the *Review* section, review the permissions and the business groups and environments to which they apply.
+
. Click *Add Permissions*. 
+
The user now has the permissions you selected in the business groups and environments you specified.

== View Limits for a User

Each administrative page for a user contains a *Limits* section that shows how close the account is to hitting limits imposed by Anypoint Platform.

To view limits:

include::partial$include-nav-users.adoc[]

. Click the user for which you want to view limits.
. Click the *Limits* tab.

[NOTE]
The number of permissions used might include internal permissions granted automatically by the system, which are not always visible in the UI.

For more information on limits in Access Management, see xref:troubleshooting-anypoint-platform-access.adoc#access-management-limits[Limits].

== Manage Deleted Users

When you delete a user from your root organization, the user is _soft deleted_. The deleted user can no longer access the root organization or business groups but maintains an Anypoint Platform account and can later be associated with another organization. Anypoint Platform maintains a record of such users for the purposes of audit logs. 

Deleting a user does not affect the assets created by that user. For instance, deleting a user who has created an API in Exchange, an API in API Manager, or an application in Runtime Manager does not have any impact on the assets they created.

An Anypoint Platform user can't sign into an organization they were removed from. If a user tries to sign in to an organization they were removed from, they are added to a new trial organization as an administrator.  

An organization administrator can invite a user to rejoin the organization they were previously removed from, but the user must create a new username. 

A deleted federated user appears in the organization as a disabled account. An organization administrator can reenable this user.

// If the user tries to sign in with their old account, the sign up request fails, stating `Cannot create user. User already exists`.

== Manage External Users of Your Public APIs

When you make an API portal public, users from any other Anypoint Platform organization can register client applications to call your API. When these users sign in to your public developer portal, they are considered external users because they are outside of your organization.

When a user logs into Anypoint Platform for the first time, they are automatically added to the *External Users* tab. From the *External Users* tab in Access management, you can view a list of all external users. You can also enable or disable each of these external users from this screen. When you disable an external user, they can no longer log in to your public portal.

You cannot search for external users in other parts of Anypoint Platform because these users do not belong to your organization and do not have additional permissions. To grant users permission to perform tasks like deploying an application, you must invite the user to join your organization.

== Manage Sensitive Account Information

As an organization administrator, you can modify some sensitive user information. For enhanced security, Access Management might ask you to reauthenticate before you can modify an organization user's email address. Connected apps and clients are exempt from reauthentication. If you have a script that makes an API call to change an organization user's email addresses, it might need to accommodate reauthentication.
