Organziation Administrators can view and configure properties for an organization.

An Anypoint Platform user who has been granted organization administrator privileges can perform the following types of tasks:

* Invite users to an organization
* Assign users to roles that define their permissions in the platform
* Edit and remove users from an organization
* Configure organization settings
* View a client ID and client secret
* Access analytics for the APIs in your organization
* Create business groups to delegate management of the resources and define the scopes of roles and permissions. A business group owner can configure additional properties at the business group level.

[NOTE]
Business groups are not enabled by default in a new Anypoint Platform account. To activate business groups in your organization, contact your MuleSoft representative.

== The Organization Owner

The user who first signs up for the Anypoint Platform organization is known as the *Organization Owner*. This is not a role but an identifier for this single user, who inherits the Organization Administrator role by default.

When the Organization Owner creates a business-group, an owner must be assigned to it. This assigned user holds an Administrator role within that business group by default.

== Organization Settings

The Organization tab displays a hierarchical tree of all of the organizations you have permissions to view. You can view and edit properties of an organization by clicking the name.

[NOTE]
Changing the name or domain name of an organization changes the deep links to any existing API Portals in your organization.

=== Client ID and Client Secret

Each environment in an organization has a unique client ID and a client secret used for authentication. To deploy proxies or APIs to CloudHub, you must use these values to configure a customer-hosted Mule Runtime or legacy API Gateway.

[NOTE]
--
Organization-level client IDs and client secrets are supported only for backward compatibility. In newer Anypoint Platform accounts, you must use the client ID and client secret for an _environment_. See xref:environments.adoc[Environments].
--

To view the client ID and secret for your organization:

. Sign into Anypoint Platform as an administrator.
. Click *Organization*.
. Click the name of the organization whose client ID/secret you want to view.

[NOTE]
--
This procedure does not apply to newer Anypoint Platform accounts, where the client ID and secret apply to environments rather than organizations.+
To change the client ID or client secret of an organization, you must contact your customer support representative.
--

=== Manage Master Organization Settings

_Organization Admin Only_

An organization administrator can modify the organization's name, domain name, and session timeout for its users. To access these settings:

. In Access Management, click *Organization* in the left menu, then click the organization name to modify.
. Modify any of the following settings, then click *Save changes*.
  * *Organization name*: This can be anything, for example, the name of the company.
  * *Domain name*: Although multiple organizations can be created by different users using the same company name, each organization must have a unique domain name.
  * *Owner*: The identifier of the organization owner.
  * *Default session timeout*: Set the amount of time (in minutes) a user is inactive before they are automatically signed out of Anypoint Platform. The default is 60 minutes, the minimum is 15 minutes, and the maximum is 180 minutes.

You can also view the organization ID, client ID, and client secret. These values apply to the master organization and grant permissions for all of the business groups contained within.

[NOTE]
Business groups have their own client ID and client secret. You can use these to access assets within an organization if you are not an organization administrator.

== Sharing Resources in an Organization

The administrator of an organization is also the administrator of any business groups in the organization. All API versions and CloudHub environments that you create from your account are associated with this organization and are only accessible to people within the organization.

The organization name does not need to be unique because a unique domain name distinguishes your organization from other organizations with the same name. To share resources with another user, it not sufficient for the other user to only register under the same company name. You must invite the user to join your organization and the user must create a new account under this organization. See xref:users.adoc#inviting-users[Inviting Users] for more information.

If your organization is configured to use an external federated identity system, you do not need to invite users. They are authenticated by the external identity provider.

After a user joins your organization, you can assign roles to grant them access to different resources within the organization. A best practice is to assign these roles as you invite new users. This ensures that the roles are in effect when users log in for the first time. See xref:managing-permissions.adoc[Roles] for more information.

If your organization contains business groups, you can give users access to multiple business groups by granting them roles within each group.


== Exchange Settings

_Organization Admin Only_

To configure the settings of your organization's private branch of Exchange, edit the Exchange owner's information and manage the number of items that your organization is able to expose on it. The URL path is based on the domain name you provide in the organization's settings.

== Business Groups


=== Create a Business Group

If you are an organization administrator and your organization is enabled for business group support, you can create business groups within your organization. To create a business group:

. In the left menu, click *Organization*.
. Click the blue plus sign next to the organization name or any of the business groups in the tree diagram.
. In the dialog box, enter:
  * *Business Group name*: Name for the new business group.
  * *Owner*: Assign an existing user in the organization to be the business group owner.
  * Select *Owner can create Business Groups* to allow the owner to create business groups that branch under this business group.
  * Select *Owner can create environments* to allow the owner to create environments within this business group.
  * You can assign some or all of the vCores that your organization owns to an individual business group. This ensures that these are used by the CloudHub deployments within the business group. You can assign these when creating the business group or edit these settings later.
  * *Static IPs*: Enable the use of static IPs.
. Click *Add Business Group*.

[NOTE]
--
Allocating vCores to a business group makes those vCores available only to the business group, and unavailable to the parent organization.
--

==== Child Business Groups

You can create hierarchical levels of business groups to provide more control over access. To create a child business group click the blue + icon next to any business group.

image::organization-2b25c.png[]

The owner of a business group can create child business groups and can assign another user as the owner of a child business group. The owner of a parent business group always retains administrator permissions for any child business group. Owners of child business groups cannot access or modify the parent business group or master organization. This includes accessing the parent business group's client ID and client secret.

When creating a child business group within a parent, only the vCores that were assigned to the parent business group can be allocated to the child.

=== Navigating Between Business Groups

When your organization has multiple business groups, you can navigate between them using the menu at the top-right corner. Switching between business groups changes the list of available CloudHub deployments, APIs, and users and roles settings.

image::switch-suborg.png[switch+suborg]

If you are not an organization administrator, you can view only the business groups that you have permissions to view. In the organization tab, the tree of your organization displays only the business groups you are a member of.

=== Creating Roles and Handling Membership to Business Groups

To obtain the membership for a business group, you must be granted a role within that business group. Members that are added to a business group can view and access the business group.

Roles can be applied at the master organization level as well as at the business group level. However, each controls different resources. APIs and CloudHub deployments that belong to a business group can be accessed only by being granted roles that belong to that business group. Resources that belong to the master organization require roles specified at the master organization level. Additionally, roles that belong to a business group can only grant access to APIs and CloudHub deployments within that business group.

When adding users to a role that belongs to a business group, all users in the master organization are granted access.

=== Deleting Business Groups

Only an organization administrator can delete business group. The root organization cannot be deleted, even by an organization administrator.
