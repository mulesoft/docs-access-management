= Permissions Available in Anypoint Platform

Anypoint Platform has a variety of permissions that control user access to various areas of Anypoint Platform. Each product owns its own permissions, but you can assign most of the permissions to xref:teams.adoc[teams] and xref:users.adoc#grant-user-permissions[individual users]. You can assign other permissions in their respective product interfaces. 

Some products require permissions from other products to use them properly. For example, Anypoint Monitoring requires users to have certain Runtime Manager permissions in addition to Anypoint Monitoring-related permissions. See each product's documentation to determine which permissions your users need and how to set them.

Depending on your organization, its licensing, and its entitlements, you might not see all of these permissions during configuration.
