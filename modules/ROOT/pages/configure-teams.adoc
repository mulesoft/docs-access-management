= Configure Teams

ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Every root organization has a _root team_ that appears by default. Every user in your organization is automatically a member of this root team and receives all permissions therein.
You can create _child teams_ under the parent team and configure those teams to have different sets of permissions.
After you create child teams and assign permissions, you can add users to each of your teams according to what permissions the users should have.
Further, you can assign _team maintainers_ who can modify users and permissions within the teams they maintain.

Team maintainers can do the following operations on their teams: 

* Change the team name
* Add or remove members from the team
* Add or remove additional team maintainers
* Move the team under different parent teams (if they maintain the other parent team)
* Delete the team

== Create a Child Team

If you have the Organization Administrator permission in your root organization, you can create child teams under any existing parent teams, including the root team. Users who have the Organization Administrator permission in business groups can create child teams under the root team and then become team maintainers for that team. Additionally, team maintainers can create child teams under teams that they maintain.
The child team inherits permissions from its parent team, but you configure additional permissions for its users.

To create a child team in the Teams feature interface:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-teams.adoc[]

. Select *Create Team*.
. Enter a unique and intuitive name for your child team. +
You can use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, commas, periods, and spaces. The character limit is 255.
+
. Select a parent team.
. Select *Save*.

The child team appears under its parent team in the list of teams. You can also select a parent team and navigate to the *Child teams* tab to see a list of all child teams under that parent team.

== Manage Team Permissions

When you begin using the Teams feature, your organization’s main team is named “Everyone at <Your Organization>” and does not have any permissions assigned.
If you have the Organization Administrator permission, you can configure permissions for this team in addition to child teams.
If you invite users to “Everyone at <Your Organization>” without assigning any permissions to that team, your users cannot execute tasks or view assets in your organization.

If you have the Organization Administrator permission in a specific business group but not your entire organization, you can assign these permissions to any of existing teams or users within your organization.

To configure permissions for teams in the Teams feature interface:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-team-maintainer.adoc[]

. Click the team for which you want to configure permissions.
. Click the *Permissions* tab.
. In the *Permissions* section, click *Add permissions*
. In the *Select Permissions* window, select the permissions that you want to add, and then select *Select contexts*.
. Select the business groups and environments to which you want to apply the permissions, and then select *Review*. +
The permissions you selected appear alongside the business groups and environments to which they apply.
+
. Select *Apply permissions*. +
The permissions you selected appear in the *Permissions* section for your team.

== Manage Team Users

If you have the Organization Administrator permission in your root organization, you can add members to existing teams using three methods:

* The Teams feature interface
* Sending an invitation to a new user via email
* External group mapping

=== Add Users using the Teams Interface

include::partial$include-nav-steps-team-maintainer.adoc[]

. In the *Teams* page, select the team to which you want to add a user.
. Select *Add members*.
. Select the name of each user you want to add to the team.
. Select the membership status that you want to assign to each user: team member or team maintainer. + 
A user who is added as a team maintainer receives team maintainer permissions as soon as you confirm their membership. 
+
. Select *Add member*. +
The user is added to the team and receives the team’s permissions.

=== Add Users using Email Invitations

When you send an email to invite a new user to your organization, you can specify teams to which the user is added automatically when they accept your invitation. The user is also automatically added to your organization’s root team, known as “Everyone at <Your Organization>” by default.

For more information about inviting a user to an existing team via email, see xref:users.adoc#inviting-a-user-to-anypoint-platform[Inviting a User to Anypoint Platform].

=== Add Users using External Group Mapping

If you use single sign-on (SSO) using SAML, OIDC, or LDAP, you can map SSO users to teams. For more information, see xref:map-users-roles-teams.adoc[Map SSO Users to Teams].

=== Manage Team Members and Maintainers

When you add a user to a team, you can select whether that user is a team maintainer or a team member. You must have the Organization Administrator permission or be a team maintainer yourself to modify team members and team maintainers.

You can designate a team maintainer to delegate team maintenance responsibilities to users without giving them additional permissions, or you can remove the team maintainer designation and convert users back to team members.

include::partial$include-nav-steps-team-maintainer-admin.adoc[]

. In the *Members* section, navigate to the user whom you want to designate as a team maintainer.
. In the *Type* selector, select either *Maintainer* or *Member*. +
The team membership for the user is updated.

[[change-team-name]]

include::partial$include-nav-steps-team-settings.adoc[]

+
. Click *Save changes*. +
Your team is renamed.

== Move a Team

include::partial$include-nav-steps-team-settings.adoc[]

. In the *Parent Team* list, select the new parent team.
. Click *Save Changes*. +
Your team and its child teams now reside under the parent team you selected.

== Delete a Team

You must have the Organization Administrator permission to delete a team. Once you delete a team, the team cannot be restored. You cannot delete the root team that represents your entire root organization.

include::partial$include-nav-steps-org-admin.adoc[]

. Click *...* next to the team that you want to delete.
. Click *Delete...*.
. Enter the name of the team that you want to delete.
. Click *Delete*. +
