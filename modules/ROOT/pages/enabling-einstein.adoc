= Enabling Einstein for Anypoint Platform

When you establish a tenant relationship with a Salesforce organization that has Einstein enabled, you can enable Einstein for your Anypoint Platform organization and store your Einstein generative AI audit and feedback data in Salesforce Data Cloud. You can then use that data for compliance, analytics, prompt adjustments, and LLM tuning to enhance your generative AI applications.

As an organization administrator, you can assign permission to the users in your organization so they can use Einstein with Anypoint Platform products that have Einstein capabilities, including:

* Anypoint Code Builder
* Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)


== Before You Begin

* Have the Organization Administrator permission and role
