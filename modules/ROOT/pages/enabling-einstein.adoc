= Enabling Einstein for Anypoint Platform

When you establish a tenant relationship with a Salesforce org that has Einstein enabled, you can enable Einstein for your Anypoint Platform organization. All of the users in your organization can use Einstein with Anypoint Platform products that have Einstein capabilities, including:

* Anypoint Code Builder
* Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)

You can store your Einstein generative AI audit and feedback data in Salesforce Data Cloud, and use that data for compliance, analytics, prompt adjustments, and LLM tuning to enhance your generative AI applications.

== Before You Begin

Before enabling Einstein in your Anypoint Platform organization, you must have:
 
* Administrative access to an Anypoint Platform organization that isn't a trial organization and isn't expired with these permissions: 
** Organization Administrator
** Anypoint Code Builder Developer
** Mule Developer Generative AI User
* The Organization Administrators role.
* Administrative access to a Salesforce organization that https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.generative_ai_enable.htm&type=5[has Einstein enabled].

== Enable Einstein in the Salesforce Org

When the Salesforce administrator enables Einstein for the connected Anypoint Platform organization, billing and tracking is done in the Salesforce org. 

When Einstein is enabled, any Anypoint Platform feature running in that organization is able to use Einstein. The Salesforce administrator isn't able to specify that Einstein can only be used for particular features, for example, IDP can use Einstein but Anypoint Code Builder can't. 

To enable Einstein for the connected Anypoint Platform organization:

. In Salesforce Setup, go to the *Quick Find* box and enter `MuleSoft`, then select *MuleSoft > MuleSoft Anypoint Platform*.
. In the *Your connected Anypoint Platform Organization* section, click *View Connection Info* to open a new dialog.
. In the *Connection to MuleSoft Anypoint Platform* window, switch between *Enabled* or *Disabled* in the *Enable Einstein for MuleSoft Anypoint Platform* section.
