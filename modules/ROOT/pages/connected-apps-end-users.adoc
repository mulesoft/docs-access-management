End users can delegate API access and log in to third-party applications using their Anypoint Platform credentials. They can also view connected apps created in their root organization or business groups.

Connected apps might request authorization from end users, and they can grant access in the following interface:

.The *Authorize App* interface enables end users to see which organization is requesting access to data and how the data is used. After the end user clicks *Grant Access*, the app is authorized to access the data indicated in the *Authorize App* interface.

End users can manage third-party apps that they have authorized in their profile settings. They can view authorized apps in their profiles by clicking on their profile icon and selecting *Profile*. The following screenshot illustrates how authorized connected apps appear within a userâ€™s profile page:

.The *Application Name* column lists the name of the app with which the user is sharing their data. The *Scopes* column lists the token granted to the app, in addition to the permissions the connected app has.

If an organization administrator blocks an app, end users cannot authorize the app to access their information.

Because most applications are developed by a third-party, MuleSoft is not liable for how an app uses the data it's requesting access to. You can navigate to the developer information link and contact the application admin if you have questions or concerns about their application.
