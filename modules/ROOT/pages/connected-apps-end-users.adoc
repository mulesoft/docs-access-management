== Managing Third-party Apps

You can manage third-party apps you have authorized in your profile settings: 

. Click your profile icon and select *Profile*.
+
The following image shows what the connected apps look like in your profile:

The *Application Name* column lists the name of the app with which the user is sharing their data. 

The *Scopes* column lists the token granted to the app, in addition to the permissions the connected app has.

If an organization administrator blocks an app, you can't authorize the app to access your information.

Because most applications are developed by third parties, MuleSoft is not liable for how an app uses the data it's requesting access to. You can navigate to the developer information link and contact the application's admin if you have questions or concerns about the application.
