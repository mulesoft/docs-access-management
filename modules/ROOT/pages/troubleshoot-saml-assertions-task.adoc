To view your SAML response in a browser, perform a single sign-on and use the developer tools in your browser to find the bearer token and SAML response.

[NOTE]
Complete this task before calling the MuleSoft Support team to assist you in troubleshooting your SAML 2.0 compliant SSO setup.

. Open a new tab in your browser and open Chrome Developer Tools, Firebug for Firefox, or a SAML tracer to capture the SAML response.

. Click the *Settings* tab.
. Copy the domain name.
. Go to `anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/_domain_name_`. This will redirect you to your IDP’s Single sign on page.
. Enter the IDP account credentials and authenticate yourself.
. In the Chrome developer tool *Form data* window, select the *Params* tab.
+
Other tools or tracers might have different labels.
. Record the SAML response element.

After recording the SAML response, use it to xref:access-management::saml-bearer-token.adoc[obtain a bearer token] to access platform APIs. It is also useful to record the SAML response to provide to MuleSoft support if you contact them.

. Log in to the MuleSoft Support Portal at the following URL:

. Provide a screen shot of your SAML configuration in Anypoint Platform.
. Include an XML SAML assertion.

== Example: Chrome Developer Tools SAML Response Element

The following image shows a SAML response element in Chrome developer tools as a result of signing in to Anypoint Platform using SSO.

In the *Network* tab (1), the `receive-id` line (2) indicates that you attempted to sign in to Anypoint Platform using single sign-on through your identity provider.
Because the signin is successful, you can expand `receive-id` and access form data that contains your SAML response element (3). Note that unsuccessful signin attempts still generate SAML response elements.
