= Audit Logging
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Changes made by users within Anypoint Platform organizations are logged through an audit logging service. You can access the data logs through the audit logging query API or through the audit logging UI.

The audit logging service provides a queryable history of actions performed within the Anypoint Platform. It keeps track of all users who have interacted with objects in the system, and timestamps those actions. It also provides mechanisms for querying the set of users who have performed actions, the set of objects that had actions performed on them, and other endpoints that enable the querying of log entries.

Audit logs have a default retention period of six years. However, users who have the Organization Administrator and Audit Log Config Manager permission can customize the retention period. For more information, see xref:audit-log-retention.adoc[]. Download your logs periodically to maintain your log files for longer than the current retention period.

== Access Audit Logging

Users who have the Organization Administrator permission or the Audit Log Viewer permission on Anypoint Platform have access to both the UI and the Query API. The audit log service is business-group aware, which means you see only logs that are relevant to your own business group.

The audit log UI is embedded in Access Management.

include::partial$include-nav-steps-no-permissions.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-audit-logs.adoc[]

The *Audit Logs* page displays the logs. You can:

* Download audit logs.
* Set a time period for audit logs to display.
* Filter audit logs by product, type, and actions.
* Search audit logs by environment, object, and user.

== Audit Log Contents

Activities represented in the log are actions that occur at a particular time, involve one or more objects, have an action type (such as `delete` or `approve`) associated with the objects, and optionally a payload which can store application-specific information such as changed fields, environment information, etc.

Each log entry has a set of properties that provides information about the activity:

* *Time*: The timestamp when the activity occurred.
* *Product*: The product where the object resides, for example, `Access Management`
* *Type*: The type of the object on which the action is performed, for example, `Organization`
* *Action*: The action associated with the object, for example, `Create`
* *Object*: The name of the object, for example, `foo`
* *User Name*: The user who performed the action, for example, `johndoe`
+
[NOTE]
--
Occasionally, there are `Anypoint Staff` log entries. This log entry is made when the audit action was performed by a user who does not belong to your organization. +
`Anypoint Staff` entries are created for when these events occur:

* An internal or system process that is a routine part of Anypoint Platform operations is performed
* The MuleSoft procurement staff changes entitlements for your organization as a result of license grants
* An action is performed by a MuleSoft employee on your behalf for other purposes, such as troubleshooting
--

* *Connected App*: Name of the connected app that takes an action on behalf of a user or itself. If a connected app did not execute the action, the payload is `N/A`.
* *Environment*: Environment names for events from API Manager, Runtime Manager, CloudHub, Partner Manager, and MQ.
* *Parent*: (Optional) The parent of the object (if any) on which the action is performed. Mainly relevant to APIs.
* *Payload*: (Optional) More information about the log properties. For example, if an Organization was created, then the payload would contain information about the organization and the owner, such as IDs.

The following is a list of actions per product and object type that Anypoint Platform audits:

== About Audit Log REST API Access

You can access the
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/audit-log-query-api/[Audit Log REST API] from the Audit Logging Query API and its

=== Use a Query Loop to make Requests in Audit Logs

The https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/organizations/8bfc8bbf-5508-419e-aadc-77dfe18a8172/assets/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/audit-log-query-api/1.0.9/files/fat-raml/zip[latest version of the query API] uses cursor pagination for efficiency, but you can continue to use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/audit-log-query-api/minor/1.0/console/method/%23245/[previous version of the query API], which uses offset pagination and returns the total number of records.


The latest version of the API uses pagination with cursors, so you can initiate query loops using cursors. Setting the `cursorPagination` query parameter to `true` enables you to use cursor paging.
When you use cursor pagination, each response returns a cursor. The cursor corresponds to the last data entry in the response data set. The subsequent request in the query loop should use the cursor value that was returned in the previous response, and so on.
When the data set is empty in response, you have reached the end of the query loop, and there is no more data to query for that time window. At that point, stop the query loop. When the data set is empty in the response, no cursor is returned.
When you use cursor pagination, `total` is not returned by default, because the query loop is not dependent on the offset or the number of total rows.
If you want to see the total when you use cursor paging, set the `doIncludeTotal` query parameter to true.

When the `cursorPagination` query parameter is true and you use `offset` and `cursor` in the query body, `cursor` is prioritized, and `offset` is ignored.


There is no mapping between `offset` and `cursor` values; And so when you run a query loop over a time window, you cannot switch to the new param somewhere in the middle by using the `cursorPagination` and continue the loop. This is because when using `cursorPagination`, `offset` is ignored and so the loop will be start from the beginning.

The cursor-based pagination API is not applicable to the CSV query. The query continues to use offset-based pagination.


The following example shows a series of calls in a query loop for cursor based query.


. The first call does not have a cursor in the body and does not request the `total`. The response returns the following data:
+
[source,console]
----
POST https://base/audit/v2/organizations/<orgId>/query?cursorPagination=true
----
+
Body:
+
[source,console]
----
{
	"startDate":"2022-09-01T22:14:47.099Z",
	"endDate":"2022-11-30T23:14:47.099Z",
}
----
+
Response:
+
[source,console]
----
{
   "data": [log entries],
   "cursor": '123_abcd'
}
----
+
You can use the cursor from the first call's response in the next call to get the next set of rows.

. The second call has a specific cursor in the request:
+
[source,console]
----
POST https://base/audit/v2/organizations/<orgId>/query?cursorPagination=true
----
+
Body:
+
[source,console]
----
{
	"startDate":"2022-09-01T22:14:47.099Z",
	"endDate":"2022-11-30T23:14:47.099Z",
	"cursor": '123_abcd'
}
----
+
Response:
+
[source,console]
----
{
	"data": [logs],
	"cursor": '123_xyz'
}
----

. The third call is the final call in a loop. Because there are no more logs to be returned, the response does not have a cursor and contains no data.
+
[source,console]
----
POST https://base/audit/v2/organizations/<orgId>/query?cursorPagination=true
----
+
Body:
+
[source,console]
----
{
	"startDate":"2022-09-01T22:14:47.099Z",
	"endDate":"2022-11-30T23:14:47.099Z",
	"cursor": '123_xyz'
}
----
+
Response:
+
[source,console]
----
{
	"data": []
}
----

. The following example shows how to use a cursor and request the total:
+
[source,console]
----
POST https://base/audit/v2/organizations/<orgId>/query?cursorPagination=true&doIncludeTotal=true
----
+
Body:
+
[source,console]
----
{
	"startDate":"2022-09-01T22:14:47.099Z",
	"endDate":"2022-11-30T23:14:47.099Z",
	"cursor": '123_abcds'
}
----
+
Response:
+
[source,console]
----
{
	"data": [logs],
	"cursor": '123_asdfg'
	"total": 50000
}
----

=== Access the API using CURL Commands

The following are example `curl` commands for accessing the API (Windows users need to download `curl` before using these commands).

Get authorization information:

[source,console]
----
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/audit/v2/organizations/<organization_id>/platforms?include_internal=false' -H 'Authorization: bearer <bearer_value>'
----

Get actions by date range:

[source,console]
----
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/audit/v2/organizations/<organization_id>/query?include_internal=false' -H 'Authorization: bearer <bearer_value>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' --data-binary '{"startDate":"2017-03-08T20:16:41.250Z","endDate":"2017-03-08T21:16:41.250Z","platforms":[],"objectTypes":[],"actions":[],"objectIds":[],"userIds":[],"ascending":false,"organizationId":"<organization_id>","offset":0,"limit":25}' --compressed ;
