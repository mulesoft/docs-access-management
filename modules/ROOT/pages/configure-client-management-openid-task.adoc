MuleSoft verifies support in Anypoint Platform for Salesforce, Okta, and OpenAM v14 Dynamic Client Registration.

[NOTE]
* Updates of clients created through this integration are not currently supported.
* Deletion of clients created through this integration are supported with the limitation that the client is removed from Anypoint Platform but will still exist in the OpenID Connect Authorization Server, and API policies will still consider them valid. +
  To enable this functionality you must opt-in by selecting the checkbox *Enable client deletion in Anypoint* under the *Advanced* settings link.

If you attempt to update a client application under OpenID Connect management, the following error message appears with an error code: `There was an error while talking to CoreServices`.

The following table contains examples of the URLs you need to supply, depending on your provider, during registration.

+
* Client Registration URL
+
The URL to dynamically register client applications as a client application for your identity provider.
+
* Authorize Header
+
The authorization header for dynamic client registration requests. This is an optional field under the *Advanced Settings* link. This header is required if the provider restricts registration requests to authorized clients.
+
** Okta: This value is `SSWS ${api_token}`, where `api_token` is an API token created through Okta.
+
** ForgeRock: This value is `Bearer ${api_token}`, where `api_token` is an API token created through ForgeRock.

+
. Sign in through your identity provider to test the configuration.

Once this has been successfully configured, you can apply the OpenID Connect OAuth Token Enforcement policy to your API Gateways through API Manager. Requesting API access through API portals dynamically generates client applications in the configured IDP that acts as a token provider.

[NOTE]
For Okta, the Okta admin needs to assign the dynamically generated clients to a user or a group of users in order for them to receive access tokens by sending over the Client ID and Client Secret.

== Grant types

If you have configured an OpenID Connect provider for client management, Anypoint Platform supports the following OAuth grant types by default when registering an API client application in the API portal:

- Implicit
- Authorization
- Refresh Token

[NOTE]
The Refresh token can be selected only if the authorization grant type is also selected.

In addition to these scopes, if you have configured the Issuer field while setting up the OIDC Dynamic Client registration provider, Anypoint platform auto-populates the Anypoint Platform UI with all grant types supported by the provider. This includes grant types such as client credentials, password, etc.
