You can use dynamic client registration to configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) client management with Anypoint Platform. Using Azure AD as a client provider enables you to authenticate and authorize API consumers with your existing configurations. Azure AD configuration in Anypoint Platform also provides a stateless microservice to convert OAuth 2.0 client application registration requests to requests supported by Azure AD.

. Click *Add Client Provider*, and then select *OpenID Connect DCR for Azure*.
+
The *Add OIDC Azure client provider* page appears.
+
. Enter a name and description for your client provider.
. Enter the following values from your identity providerâ€™s configuration:
.. *Issuer*: URL that the OpenID provider asserts is its trusted issuer.
.. *Tenant ID for Azure AD*: The tenant ID from Azure AD. For more information on obtaining your tenant ID, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant[How to find your Azure Active Directory tenant ID].
.. *Client ID*: The client ID for an existing client in your identity provider (IdP) that is capable of creating applications in Azure AD.
.. *Client Secret*: The client secret that corresponds to the client ID.
. Expand the *Advanced Settings* section. The following selections are optional:
.. *Disable server certificate validation*: Disables server certificate validation if your Azure AD client management instance presents a self-signed certificate, or one signed by an internal certificate authority.
.. *Enable client deletion in Anypoint Platform*: Enables the deletion of clients created with this integration.
.. *Enable client deletion and updates in IdP*: To use this option, you must also select the *Enable client deletion in Anypoint Platform* option. This option enables you to update and delete external clients in the configured IdP through an outbound call made by Azure AD to `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/{clientId}`. +

== Microsoft Identity Platform Support

=== Access Tokens 

For your APIs, Azure AD client management in Anypoint Platform supports both https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens[v1 and v2 JSON Web Tokens] (JWTs) on Microsoft identity platform. 

=== OAuth 2.0 Endpoints

Anypoint Platform supports only tokens obtained using Azure AD v2.0 endpoints, also known as Microsoft identity platform endpoints. For example, Anypoint Platform supports the token endpoint: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/token`. 

Use the following properties when you are using the Authorization Code grant type to obtain a token:

* `authorize url`: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`
* `token url`: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
* `client id`: {your client id}
* `client secret`: {your client secret}
* `scope`: `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`

Anypoint Platform does not support custom scopes. Use the default scope for Microsoft Graph. 

=== Grant Types

Microsoft doesn't support specifying grant types when https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-post-applications?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http[creating a new application] and it supports "authorization_code" and "client_credentials" by default.
