This topic describes how use roles to manage permissions within Anypoint Platform. This topic assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization or that you have API Versions Owner permissions and want to manage user permissions for an API version.

A role is a set of pre-defined permissions for each product component within Anypoint Platform. Depending on the product, you can use pre-defined roles with standard permissions, or you can specify your own permissions for each role. You can assign individuals to a role, or you can assign a role to another role.

Anypoint Platform provides two types of roles:

* *Default roles*: roles that are created automatically when an organization or business group is created. These roles provide permissions and access to core functionality of Anypoint Platform. You can modify default roles by assigning users or other roles. However, you cannot delete a default role.

* *Custom roles*: roles that a user can create, customize, and delete. You can assign users or roles to a custom role. You can also associate a custom role to a specific application. For example, you can create a custom role called Application Designer and assign that role to the Design Center application. This enables users assigned the Application Designer role to access the Design Center application.

To access the Roles menu in Access Management, ensure that you are in the correct business group by clicking the menu next to your username on the top-right of the screen.

Please be aware that roles are assigned per Business Group (Business Group specific).

[NOTE]
When a new business group is created, all the users with the Organization Administrators role in the parent business group are also added as organization administrators in the newly created business group (the child business group). However, when creating a new user as an organization administrator in the parent business group, this role is not propagated to all the sub business groups.

== Default Roles

Default roles are roles that are created by default within an Organization.

=== List of Default Roles and Permission Scopes

The following are the default roles that are automatically created as part of an organization. Each default Role in Anypoint Platform contains a set of pre-defined permissions and scope of actions that enable the user to perform specific actions within the platform.

== Custom Roles

As an organization administrator, you can create custom roles by combining API or applications, permissions, and users. Depending on the product to which the role is associated, these options may vary. For example, API roles cannot be removed and their permissions cannot be modified, however you can add a description and add users to that role.

If the only permissions associated with your role are Portal Viewer​, *Exchange Viewer​ and/or ​Application Owner​, then users belonging to this role won't have access to the organization's support portal.


[NOTE]
Product permissions are specific to a single environment. If you have multiple environments and want to give a role the same permissions on all, you must add these permissions multiple times, one for each environment.
